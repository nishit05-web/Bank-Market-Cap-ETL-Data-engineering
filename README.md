# Bank-Market-Cap-ETL-Data-engineering
This is a ETL project which is frequently used by data engineers
In this project i have extracted data in JSON file format from wikipedia tables containing data in tabular form
I have extrated the data in json,I have also extracted real time currency exchange rate API and converted it to json
Then i transformed the datframe from the Market cap present in USD to GBP using exchange rate
After this i loaded the data and converted the data finally to csv file format which can be used By companies in UK to do data analysis.
In this way I completed by ETL project.
